    "> Generator functions are described below, while asynchronous generator functions are described separately in section Asynchronous generator functions.\n",

    "> When a generator function is called, it returns an iterator known as a generator. That generator then controls the execution of the generator function. *The execution starts when one of the generator’s methods is called. At that time, the execution proceeds to the first yield expression, where it is suspended again, returning the value of **expression_list** to the generator’s caller*. By suspended, we mean that all local state is retained, including the current bindings of local variables, the instruction pointer, the internal evaluation stack, and the state of any exception handling. When the execution is resumed by calling one of the generator’s methods, the function can proceed exactly as if the yield expression were just another external call. The value of the yield expression after resuming depends on the method which resumed the execution. If \\__next\\__() is used (typically via either a for or the next() builtin) then the result is **None**. (Note that the result is **None** means that the current yield expression always evaluates to **None**.) Otherwise, if send() is used, then the result will be the value passed in to that method.\n",
    "\n",
    "> All of this makes generator functions quite similar to coroutines; they yield multiple times, they have more than one entry point and their execution can be suspended. The only difference is that a generator function cannot control where the execution should continue after it yields; the control is always transferred to the generator’s caller.\n",

    "> Starts the execution of a generator function or resumes it at the last executed yield expression. When a generator function is resumed with a \\__next\\__() method, the current yield expression always evaluates to **None**. (Note that it does not return **None**.) The execution then continues to the next yield expression, where the generator is suspended again, and the value of the **expression_list** is returned to \\__next\\__()’s caller. If the generator exits without yielding another value, a StopIteration exception is raised.\n",

    "\n",
    "> Resumes the execution and “sends” a value into the generator function. The *value* argument becomes the result of the current yield expression. The send() method returns the next value yielded by the generator, or raises StopIteration if the generator exits without yielding another value. When send() is called to start the generator, it must be called with None as the argument, because there is no yield expression that could receive the value."
